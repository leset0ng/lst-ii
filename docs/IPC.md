# IPC Reference

ii exposes IPC targets you can call from Niri keybinds, scripts, or your terminal when you're feeling fancy.

From terminal (for testing, or showing off):

```bash
qs -c ii ipc call <target> <function>
```

In Niri config (for actual keybinds):

```kdl
bind "Key" { spawn "qs" "-c" "ii" "ipc" "call" "<target>" "<function>"; }
```

Yes, it's verbose. No, there's no shorter way. Welcome to IPC.
